This is the main repository of UNCode.

UNCode is an online platform built on top of [INGInious][inginious_url] (**v0.5**) for frequent practice 
and automatic evaluation of computer programming, Jupyter Notebooks and hardware description language (VHDL/Verilog) 
assignments. Also provides a pluggable interface with your existing LMS. 

UNCode is currently used at the Universidad Nacional De Colombia, Campus Bogotá. UNCode supports automatic evaluation 
in languages like: C/C++, Java 7/8, Python 3, Verilog, VHDL and Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, has been employed in 
courses like: Basic Computer Programming, Data Structures, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum 
Programming, Programming Languages, among others. See the complete [list of courses][uncode_url].

UNCode provides a backend which manages interaction with Docker and grading code, and a frontend which 
allows students to submit their code in a simple and beautiful interface. The frontend also includes a 
simple administration interface that allows teachers to check the progression of their students and to 
modify exercises in a simple way.

The backend is independent of the frontend and was made to be used as a library.

UNCode can be used as an external grader for Learning Managment Systems (LMS) such as Moodle or OpenEDX.
