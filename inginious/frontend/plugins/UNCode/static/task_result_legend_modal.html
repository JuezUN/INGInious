                                "Runtime error" means that your code failed while it was executing, which means that your

                                code could crash, some of them are: division by zero, invalid memory access (e.g. bad
                                index access to an array), and null pointers.

                                got stuck in an infinite loop or your code does solve the problem but takes much longer

                                <strong>Tips:</strong> Check and debug your code as it may be stuck in a loop. If your
                                code does in fact solve the problem but it is too slow, try to find another solution,
                                one that takes less time to compute.
