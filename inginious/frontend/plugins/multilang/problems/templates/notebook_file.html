                    In general, when submitting a notebook, all <strong>Python 3.5 code</strong> is supported on UNCode.
                    However, Ipython notebooks and python code differ in some functionalities, then UNCode might support
                    them or not. Also, there are some things you should bear in mind when creating your notebook.

                        <strong>Python modules:</strong><br>
                        You are able to use the next python modules in addition to the pre installed python modules:<br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">
                            import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, seaborn, datascience, plotly,
                            cufflinks,
                            bokeh, tabulate, nltk, tensorflow, Keras
                        </code>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Installing modules:</strong>
                        <br>
                        All the modules and data you require are already installed and supported by UNCode.<br>
                        Then, when you have lines installing a module, for instance:
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">!pip install pandas</code> or
                        using <code class="language-python" data-language="python">conda</code>, these
                        lines are automatically removed from your notebook to avoid runtime execution errors.
                        <br><br>
                        In case you want to use one module and it is not in the previous list, do not hesitate on
                        reaching out for support.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Print expressions:</strong><br>
                        Usually while executing your notebook on your runtime you might add some
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">print</code>
                        expressions, though, these expressions are deleted and these outputs are not shown in the
                        submission feedback.

                        <strong>Internet access in grading environment:</strong><br>
                        The internet access when your code is being graded is dependant on the task. Some tasks might
                        allow it or not.
                        <br>
                        In case you are allowed to access internet, this mainly will work to download files or data,
                        for instance datasets. As stated above, you cannot install modules.
                        <br>
                        In case there is not access, be careful when using code that requires internet access as it
                        will fail while grading.

                        <strong>Magic functionality execution:</strong><br>
                        <i>Magic</i> functions are allowed when your notebook is graded. For example the next line:
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">%matplotlib inline</code>
                        <br>
                        In case your notebook contains some lines like this, they will be automatically removed
                        to avoid runtime execution errors.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Commands execution:</strong><br>
                        IPython Notebooks provide a functionality to execute commands like these:<br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">!ls</code><br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">!pwd</code><br>
                        However, this kind of lines are transformed as follows:
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">!ls</code> is turned into the following
                        code:
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">
                            import subprocess
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">
                            call = subprocess.run(["ls"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">
                            print(call.stdout.decode('utf-8')
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        That code will do the same for you as in the notebook.
                        However, you are not allowed to assign the result of command execution to variables, for
                        instance the next line will return an error:
                        <br>
                        <code class="language-python" data-language="python">result = !ls</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Google Colab modules</strong><br>
                        When you use Google Colaboratory (Colab) and you want to load and read data from Google Drive,
                        you are required to use some python modules unique in Colab. These modules are not supported
                        by UNCode.
                        Then, make sure when you submit your notebook, you do not include it.<br><br>
