                    In general, when submitting a notebook, all python 3.5 code is supported on UNCode. However,
                    Ipython notebooks and python code differ in some functionalities, then UNCode might support them
                    or not. Also, there are some things you should bear in mind when creating your notebook.

                        <strong>Additional python modules:</strong><br><br>
                        You are able to use the next python modules in addition to the pre installed python modules:<br>
                        <code>import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, seaborn, datascience, plotly,
                            cufflinks, bokeh, tabulate, nltk</code><br><br>
                        In case you want to use one module and it is not in the previous list, do not hesitate on
                        reaching out for support.

                        <strong>Not internet access from the grading environment:</strong><br><br>
                        When you submit your notebook, take care of not using code that requires internet
                        access.
                        For instance installing a python module or installing data with <code>nltk.download()</code>.
                        All the modules and data you require are already installed and supported by UNCode.<br>
                        Then, when you have lines installing a module, for instance:
                        <code class="multiline-code">!pip install pandas</code>
                        These lines are automatically removed from your notebook to avoid runtime execution errors.

                        <strong>Magic functionality execution:</strong><br><br>
                        Magics function are automatically removed from your notebook. For example the next line:<br>
                        <code class="multiline-code">%matplotlib inline</code>
                        In case your notebook contains some lines like this, they will be automatically removed
                        to avoid runtime execution problems.

                        <strong>Commands execution:</strong><br><br>
                        As notebooks provide a functionality to execute commands like these:<br>
                        <code class="multiline-code">!ls</code><br>
                        <code class="multiline-code">!pwd</code><br>
                        These kind of lines are transformed to be able to run the commands, for example <code>!ls</code>
                        is turned into the following code:
                        <code class="multiline-code"><br>import subprocess<br>call = subprocess.run(["ls"],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)<br>print(call.stdout.decode('utf-8')<br></code>

                        That code will do the same for you as in the notebook.
                        However, you are not allowed to assign the result of command execution to a variables, for
                        instance: <code>result = !ls</code>. In that case, your code will return an error.

                        <strong>Reading files from Google Drive:</strong><br><br>
                        When you use Google Colaboratory (Colab) and you want to load and read data from Google Drive,
                        you are
                        required to use some python modules unique in Colab. These modules are not supported by UNCode,
                        thus, make sure when you submit your notebook, you do not include it.<br><br>
                        In order to read data, for example a .csv file, you should run your notebook locally using
                        Jupyter.
